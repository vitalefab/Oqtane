Oqtane is an open source CMS and Application Framework that provides advanced functionality for developing web, mobile, and desktop applications on .NET. It leverages Blazor to compose a fully dynamic digital experience which can be hosted on Static Blazor, Blazor Server, Blazor WebAssembly, or Blazor Hybrid (via .NET MAUI).

Oqtane was created by [Shaun Walker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shaunbrucewalker/) and was inspired by his earlier efforts with DotNetNuke... however Oqtane is a native Blazor application written from the ground up using modern .NET Core technology and a Single Page Application (SPA) architecture. It is a modular application framework offering a fully dynamic page compositing model, multi-site support, designer friendly themes, and extensibility via third party modules.
